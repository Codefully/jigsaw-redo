# Stock Advantage (Inventory)

Our Stock Advantage Module enables a distributor to monitor the behaviors and operational costs of their stock ordering process. The system identifies where distributors are incurring unnecessary operational costs due to the behaviors encouraged within their own stock replenishment platforms.  In addition this module can identify a best in class range of products to maximize the opportunity and sales revenue with particular manufacturers and product lines.

The module highlights key inefficient behaviors that may otherwise go unnoticed:

1.  Ordering the same item more frequently than necessary
2.  Not supporting an appropriately diverse range of products
3.  Inconsistent unable to be fulfilled from stock
4.  Unnecessary product transfers and material handling
5.  Items that should be sold off or returned to manufacturers

Our Stock Advantage Module has generated revenue improvements ranging from 300 – 1000 basis points (3 – 10%) on stock sales.
