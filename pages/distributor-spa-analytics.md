# SPA Analytics

Our SPA Control Module enables a distributor to monitor the performance of their SPA contracts and the effectiveness of the pricing strategy against the sales performance of the account. Distributors are able to review the revenue and profitability generated for each of their manufacturer’s SPA contracts.

- Too many items discounted on the contract
- Little to no strategic pricing in place for high volume and/or low volume items
- Little to no differentiation between large and small customers
- No customer segmentation

Jigsaws’ SPA Control Module has generated gross margin improvements ranging from 300 – 600 basis points (3 – 6%) on SPA sales.

To get started in more effectively managing your company’s profitability, we suggest a first or initial step utilizing our SPA analytics service.

We analyzes each of a distributor’s SPA contracts against 7 key measures, making recommendations that will measurably improve both the effectiveness and the profitability of each SPA contract.

For increased visibility and through Jigsaw’s web-based measurement platform, distributors are able to easily monitor and measure profitability improvements at the SPA contract level, as well as at the customer and product pricing levels.
