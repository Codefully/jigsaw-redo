### Manufacturer
# Vendor Managed Inventory

Jigsaw’s Inventory Gap Analysis/VMI system (Stock Advantage), has been designed to work in tandem with a manufacturer’s current order management platform, goes well beyond the use of daily sales to generate stocking recommendations. 

Using a series of mathematical models that have been successfully implemented by a world-class manufacturer for the past several years, Jigsaw’s Inventory Management system builds a unique profile and generates an individual stocking recommendation for each of your distributors’ locations, taking into account such variables as:
 
1. Customer demand &amp; demographics
2. Market trends &amp; product life cycles
3. Product gaps in a distributor’s stocking portfolio
