# SPA Analytics

Typically, SPA contracts take a shotgun approach in order to avoid complex administration. Customers are offered broad and deep discounts that do not target their true pricing concerns. As a result, manufacturers and distributors both decrease their profit levels unnecessarily, rather than selectively maintaining a competitive edge on those products where it is needed to secure a customer's business while maintaining a more profitable position on those products where it is not.

Our SPA Control Module enables a distributor to monitor the performance of their SPA contracts, as well as the effectiveness of their current pricing strategy.

<h2 class="color-orange mt-5 mb-3">Common SPA contact issues</h2>

- Too many items discounted on the contract
- Little to no strategic pricing in place for high volume and/or low volume items
- Little to no differentiation between large and small customers
- No customer segmentation
- No proactive management of the contract
- Discount opportunities not relayed to customers
