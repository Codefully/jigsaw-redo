# Stock Advantage (Inventory)

Our Stock Advantage Module enables a distributor to monitor the behavior and operational cost of their stock ordering process. By identifying where unnecessary operational costs are incurred (due to the behavior encouraged by most distributors' stock replenishment platforms), significant operational savings can be achieved.

The module identifies key inefficient behaviors that may otherwise go unnoticed:

1.  Ordering the same item more frequently than necessary
2.  Not supporting an appropriately diverse range of product
3.  Inconsistent and unreliable fulfillment from stock
4.  Unnecessary product transfers and material handling
5.  Items that should be sold off or returned to manufacturers

Current inventory systems are basically reactive--triggered by sales and demand for customers. This means in every case your customers have to put up with disruptions in their supply until your inventory system catches up. What if you could anticipate their needs? Or understand the potential hidden in the product lines you're currently selling?

Our module can identify a best-in-class range of products to proactively maximize sales and revenue opportunities with individual manufacturers and product lines.

Increase sales. Reduce Costs. Eliminate redundant inventory. And set up your business for tomorrow, rather than yesterday. All by using our Stock Advantage system.
