# Price Optimization

Jigsaw Systems offers a pricing optimization service focused on thru-stock business and drop-ship sales (stock and non-stock), including Special Pricing Agreement (SPA) contracts.

We begin by evaluating your current profitability performance by conducting an analysis of your company’s last 12 months' revenues. By modeling your customers and products into buying patterns, Jigsaw is able to identify those transactions that are truly price sensitive compared to those where price is less of a factor.

Using a pricing architecture that is tailored to meet your business goals and objectives, we can improve your company’s non-negotiated sales profitability (including product sold via SPA contracts and products not sold from stock). Typical results yield potential increases in gross margin percentage of sales between 4% and 8% for your overall stock business.

One component of our offering is a price analysis web tool, which affords you the ability to monitor and  measure the resultant improvements in SPA and thru-stock profits, comparing pricing baselines against the new pricing models that are adopted. Our process will facilitate a new pricing culture within your company, one that is focused on making wise price/margin decisions that truly take into account actual sales requirements within your marketplace.

The first step in working with Jigsaw is a review of your current profitability performance without any long term commitment necessary. We will provide our findings on your current pricing strategy and identify clearly where you may have room for improvement, to the extent that we will be able to target financially how much improvement can be gained for your business. From there we can work together to realize that goal by educating and training your internal team, sales force and other key players. Learn how to ensure your business is priced correctly for your marketplace without the need to give price away unnecessarily.

Utilizing Jigsaw's process will transform the performance of your company and position you to succeed in your marketplaces for years to come.
