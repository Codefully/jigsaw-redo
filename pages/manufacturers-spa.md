# SPA Management

Jigsaw Systems offers a complete solution for the complexity of Special Pricing Agreements. Our system breaks down into three areas: Contract Administration, Rebate Claims and Contract Profitability Measurement & Profitability. Manufacturers can implement each process individually, or all processes together as one holistic solution. 

<h2 class="color-orange mt-2">Contract Administration</h2>

THe biggest challenge with SPA's is simply identifying the business opportunity, documenting the pricing discount and ensuring manufacturer and distributor have agreement on the final negotiated contract. Jigsaw offers a first-of-it's-kind solution for the Electrical Industry, one that digitizes the entire process. Accessible by manufactures, distributors and sales reps, contracts can be requested, go through an electronically tracked approval process and be freely accessible so all parties understand what was agreed to. 

In addition the platform facilitates the renegotiation and modification of contracts so they can change as business conditions change. This allows for a more responsive business environment, diminishing the loss of SPA customers and allowing for expanding sales under existing contracts. 

<h2 class="color-greenmt-2">Rebate Claiming and Auditing</h2>

There are two methods to calculate the rebate due a distributor. Cost of replenishment calculates the cost to replace the item in their inventory at their current pricing levels, and is the most common method in the industry today. Cost of acquisition links the rebate claim to a stock order placed by the distributor to reflect their true initial investment in the product. 

Jigsaw facilitates both processes. In doing so Jigsaw can eliminate many of the mispayments that exist for most manufacturers today, and remove the need for distributor deductions. All claims are audited in advance, and distributors can identify claims that will be rejected or calculated at different rates in advance of their submission. The administration required to process rebates can be reduced by 80%+.
