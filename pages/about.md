# Who We Are

Jigsaw Systems Inc was founded to solve some of the complex data issues facing the Electrical Industry. As manufacturers and distributors work closer together and the need for data process management escalates it is clear that there is a need for improved systems and processes to remove confusion, reduce administration and increase the effectiveness of the distribution channel.

Jigsaw is focused on working with the Electrical Industry based on our insider perspective and experience. We are the only software provider to come from inside the industry that is focused on improving the issues of SPA contract management, Inventory Optimization and Price Strategy.
