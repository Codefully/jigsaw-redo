# Price Optimization

Jigsaw Systems offers a price-optimization service focused on thru-stock business and drop-ship sales (stock and non-stock), including Special Pricing Agreement (SPA) contracts.

We begin by evaluating your current profitability performance by analyzing your company’s last 12 months' revenues. By modeling your customers and products into buying patterns, Jigsaw is able to identify those transactions that are truly price sensitive compared to those where price is less of a factor.

<h2 class="color-green mt-5 mb-3">Impact and Results</h2>

Using a pricing architecture that is tailored to achieve your business goals and objectives, we can improve your company’s non-negotiated sales profitability (including product sold via SPA contracts and products not sold from stock). Typical results yield increases in gross margin percentage of sales between 4% and 8% for your overall stock business.

A unique component of our offering is a price analysis web tool, which enables you to monitor and measure the resultant improvements in SPA and thru-stock profits, comparing pricing baselines against the new pricing models that are adopted. Our process will facilitate a new pricing culture within your company, one that is focused on making wiser price/margin decisions that truly take into account actual sales requirements within your marketplace.

The first step in working with Jigsaw is let us review your current profitability performance without your having to incur any long-term obligation. We will provide our findings and clearly identify areas where you may have room for improvement, as well as the total potential increase in margin dollars that could be realized. From there we will work together to achieve that goal by educating and training your internal team, sales force and other key players. Learn how to ensure that your products are priced correctly for your marketplace so you aren't giving away price unnecessarily.

Utilizing Jigsaw's Price-Optimization Service will transform your company's performance, positioning you to succeed in your marketplace for years to come.
