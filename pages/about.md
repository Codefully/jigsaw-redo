# Who We Are

Jigsaw Systems, Inc. was founded in 2008 to solve many of the complex data issues facing the Electrical Industry. As manufacturers and distributors work more closely together and the need for data process management escalates, there is a clear need for improved systems and processes to remove confusion, reduce administration and increase the effectiveness of the distribution channel.

Drawing on our insider perspective and experience, Jigsaw is the only software provider to come from inside the industry that is focused on solving the issues associated with SPA Contract Management, Inventory Optimization and Pricing Strategy.
