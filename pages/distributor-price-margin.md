# Price Matrix Management

Jigsaw Systems offers a three-phased pricing analytics service  that we call Market Edge, encompassing both SPA contracts, as well as every day, thru-stock business (stock and non-stock).

We conduct thorough pricing analysis of your company’s thru-stock business. By thoroughly analyzing a customer’s annual volume against their product buying patterns; Jigsaw is able to identify those products that are truly price sensitive; as well as model, test and recommend an effective pricing architecture, improving a company’s thru-stock profitability (including product sold via SPA contracts) from 2.5 to 5%.

Jigsaws’ Profit Builder Module has generated gross margin improvements ranging from 200 – 400 basis points (2 – 4%) on thru stock sales.

Though the price analysis web tool is stand alone, it also works in conjunction with our SPA analytics service, combined the integrated measurement platform enables a distributor to quickly and accurately measure the resultant profitability improvements against the SPA contract and thru-stock pricing baselines that existed before the new pricing models were adopted.
