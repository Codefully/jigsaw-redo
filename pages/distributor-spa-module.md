### Distributor

# SPA Analytics

Our SPA Control Module enables a distributor to monitor the performance of their SPA contracts and the effectiveness of the pricing strategy against the sales performance of the account.  Distributors are able to review the revenue and profitability generated for each of their manufacturer’s SPA contracts, as well as focus on areas of inactivity and price erosion typically found within SPA contracts, including:

1. Too many items discounted on the contract
2. Little to no strategic pricing in place for high volume and/or low volume items
3. Little to no differentiation between large and small customers
4. No customer segmentation

Jigsaws’ SPA Control Module has generated gross margin improvements ranging from 300 – 600 basis points (3 – 6%) on SPA sales.

As a first or initial step in more effectively managing your company’s profitability, Jigsaw offers its SPA analytics service.

Jigsaw analyzes each of a distributor’s SPA contracts against 7 key measures, making recommendations that will measurably improve both the effectiveness and the profitability of each SPA contract.

Through Jigsaw’s web-based measurement platform, the distributor is able to easily monitor and measure profitability improvements at the SPA contract level, as well as at the customer and product pricing levels.
