# SPA Analytics

Typically SPA contracts take a wide approach in order to avoid complex administration. Customers are offered wide and deep discounts that do not target their true pricing concerns. As a result manufacturers and distributors both decrease their profit levels unnecessarily, rather than selectively maintaining a competitive edge where required to secure a customers business yet ensuring a profitable long term relationship.

Our SPA Control Module enables a distributor to monitor the performance of their SPA contracts and the effectiveness of the current pricing strategy.

<h2 class="color-orange mt-3 mb-1">Common SPA contact issues</h2>

- Too many items discounted on the contract
- Little to no strategic pricing in place for high volume and/or low volume items
- Little to no differentiation between large and small customers
- No customer segmentation
- No proactive management of the contract
- Discount opportunities not relayed to customers
