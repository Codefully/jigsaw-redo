SPA analytics
Web-based SPA processing

Our SPA services have delivered:

1. 20%+ increases in SPA revenues
2. 10%+ improvements in SPA profitability
3. Significant productivity gains in SPA administration

As an initial step in more effectively managing your SPA contracts, Jigsaw offers its SPA analytics consulting service.  Through this stand-alone service, Jigsaw is able to analyze each of a manufacturer’s SPA contracts against 7 key measures, making recommendations that will measurably improve both the effectiveness and the profitability of each SPA contract.

For those manufacturer’s who are interested in more effectively managing, processing and auditing their SPA contracts, Jigsaw offers its web-based SPA platform.  Jigsaw’s SPA platform is able to encompass the entirety of the ship & debit management process (or each component taken individually), from contract setup, administration and auditing rebate claims, to measuring contract performance via an array of simple, easy-to-use analysis tools.

Listed below are the seven key measures of SPA Business performance that are critical in identifying the efficiency and effectiveness of pricing agreements, identifying where contracts are being used correctly or where they are unnecessarily giving away price for no commercial benefit.

Seven Key Measures of SPA Business Performance

Contract Efficiency
This measurement compares the number of items claimed on an SPA to the number of items made available for discount pricing.  This measurement quickly identifies those items where a targeted price- discounting strategy is more appropriate than a broader-based discounting strategy.  The inability to apply a targeted pricing strategy to a contract is the primary source of price erosion.

Proactive management of this measure can reduce the rebates required to support SPA contracts by 10%-15%.

Volume Discount Ratio
This measurement compares the average discount obtained by a contract to the volume of sales over the last year.  This measurement reliably identifies whether a scalable pricing strategy is in place in a given market.  The absence of a scalable pricing strategy highlights a lack of discipline when quoting different customer opportunities.
Implementing a volume discount ratio strategy can improve margins with smaller contracts by as much as 20%.

Last Modification Date
This measurement identifies the last time the contract was modified (For the purposes of this measurement, modification means updating a contract’s terms, rather than merely reactivating the terms of an existing contract).  Long-term unaltered contracts generally reveal instances where a contract’s terms have been renewed by force of habit rather than through thoughtful consideration.
Ongoing modification of existing contracts is critical to ensuring that a contract is both valid and effective; it also helps limit many of the problems typically found in SPA contracts.

Velocity Mix
This measurement identifies the ratio between the number of A, B, C and D items that are purchased on a contract (between “A” items that are bought at least monthly thru to “D” items that are purchased only once or twice a year).  The higher the ratio of slower selling items, the more likely it is that price has been given away unnecessarily.
Implementing a velocity mix pricing strategy can improve profitability by upwards of an additional 5%.

Median Transaction Size
This measurement looks at the buying habits of the customer, order by order.  By understanding a customer’s buying habits, we can more easily determine whether an SPA is the best method for supporting that customer.   This measurement quickly uncovers where an SPA has been used for a project job rather than to support ongoing sales.
Reviewing this measure helps identify contracts that would be more effective and profitable with reduced discounts.  Recovery of up to 10%+ of rebate payments is not uncommon.

Significant Product Count
This measurement identifies how many products make up 80% of a customer’s purchases.  This value is then compared to the contract’s efficiency and velocity mix to identify those items that are actually price sensitive.  Since price sensitive items generally represent only a fraction of the items purchased via an SPA, this measurement helps target and track those items where discounting is actually critical to maintaining the customer’s account.
Combining a strategy of volume discount, velocity mix and price-sensitive products can increase the profitability of SPA contracts by upwards of 25%.

Monthly Sales Standard Deviation
This measurement identifies the stability of a contract customer’s monthly purchases by comparing the standard deviation to the monthly average.  This measurement quickly identifies contracts where the buying pattern has changed significantly, or where no consistent level of purchases has been established.
Better identifying the buying habits of the customer can lead to increased sales opportunities. Revenue increases of 20% are not uncommon.
