# Inventory Management

Jigsaw’s Inventory system (Stock Advantage) goes well beyond the use of daily sales to generate stocking recommendations.

Using a series of mathematical models that have been successfully implemented by world-class manufacturers for the past several years, our system builds a unique profile and generates an individual stocking recommendation for each of your distributors’ locations, taking into account such variables as:
 
1. Customer demand &amp; demographics  
2. Market trends &amp; product life cycles  
3. Product gaps in a distributor’s stocking portfolio  

Distributors use this system to supplement their own Inventory Platform. Most distributors use a reactive set of algorithms, and only have access to what they sell. Manufacturers have knowledge of what works across their entire product line, and can provide all manner of increased intelligence and direction to inventories.

As a result sales increase, profitability increases and operational costs decrease. Manufacturers rely on their channel to sell them in the markets, and it's imperative they have a strategy to ensure their distributors have an inventory that works for everyone. Without such a strategy established most manufacturers will always struggle to utilize their channel effectively. Inventory engagement is a must have for all manufacturers.
