# Price Optimization

Jigsaw Systems offers a pricing optimization service focused on thru-stock business and drop ship sales(stock and non-stock), including Special Pricing Agreement (SPA) contracts.

We begin by evaluating your current profitability performance with an analysis of your company’s thru-stock business. By modelling your customers and products into  buying patterns Jigsaw is able to identify and scale those transactions that are truly price sensitive compared to those where price is less of a factor.

We will provide our findings on your current pricing strategy and identify clearly where you may have room for improvement, to the extent that we will be able to target how much improvement can be gained for your business. From there we can work together to realize that goal by educating and training your internal team, sales force and other key players. learn how to ensure your business is priced correctly for your marketplace without the need to give price away unnecessarily when it isn't required.

Our Profit Builder Module enables a distributor to quickly analyze the effectiveness of their current pricing matrix to develop, monitor and implement a consistent, repeatable pricing strategy based each customer’s specific purchasing profile.  

The platform provides insights on current business dynamics to identify where price needs to be competitive and where opportunities for margin improvement exist. The resulting pricing matrix takes into account several business dynamics, to find the best possible mix for our clients to maximize pricing.
