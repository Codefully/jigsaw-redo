# Manufacturer Promotions and Incentives

Working with a distribution channel means manufacturers are constantly competing with other manufacturers for the mindshare of the distributor location. Distributors are an extension of your sales force, tens of thousands of employees who daily have the opportunity to sell your products and grow your business. 

The model of using your own sales force or rep agency can never truly replicate the distributor sales force, and in particular distributors can focus on the smaller, more profitable customers that improve margins and diversity your customer base. Therefore it is imperative to have a means to access the distributor workforce and help them make you successful. After all your success is also their success.
