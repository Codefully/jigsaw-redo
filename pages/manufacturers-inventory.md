# Inventory Management

Jigsaw’s Inventory system (Stock Advantage) goes well beyond the use of daily sales to generate stocking recommendations.

Using a series of mathematical models that have been successfully implemented by world-class manufacturers for  several years, our system builds a unique profile and predictively generates an individual stocking recommendation for each of your distributors’ locations, taking into account such variables as:

1. Customer demand &amp; demographics  
2. Market trends &amp; product life cycles  
3. Product gaps in a distributor’s stocking portfolio  

Most distributors use a reactive set of algorithms, and only have access to what they sell. Manufacturers, on the other hand, are well aware of what sells across their spectrum of products, but generally lack the means to discern which products are actually being sold within a specific territory.  Jigsaw's Inventory Management module, not only lets your distributors know which of your products they should be stocking and at what levels, but it also lets them know what their probability of selling these products will be.

As a result, sales and profitability increase and operational costs decrease. Manufacturers rely on their channel to sell their products in the marketplace, so it's imperative they have a strategy to ensure their distributors have an inventory that works for everyone. Without such a strategy in place, most manufacturers will struggle to utilize their channel effectively. Inventory engagement is a must have for all manufacturers.
