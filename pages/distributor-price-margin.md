Distributors > Price Matrix Management

Jigsaw Systems offers a three-phased pricing analytics service  that we call Market Edge, encompassing both SPA contracts, as well as every day, thru-stock business (stock and non-stock).

Jigsaw Systems conducts a thorough pricing analysis of your company’s thru-stock business.  By thoroughly analyzing a customer’s annual volume against their product buying patterns; Jigsaw is able to identify those products that are truly price sensitive; as well as model, test and recommend an effective pricing architecture, improving a company’s thru-stock profitability (including product sold via SPA contracts) from 2.5 to 5%.


Our Profit Builder Module enables a distributor to quickly analyze the effectiveness of their current pricing matrix to develop, monitor and implement a consistent, repeatable pricing strategy based each customer’s specific purchasing profile.  The platform provides insights on current business dynamics to identify where price needs to be competitive and where opportunities for margin improvement exist. The resulting pricing matrix takes into account several business dynamics, including

1. A customer’s total annualized purchases
2. Total number of each SKU purchased by each customer
3. Total number of transactions for each SKU per customer
4. Margin gain desired per customer per SKU
5. SKU sales history and customer sensitivity to price
 
Jigsaws’ Profit Builder Module has generated gross margin improvements ranging from 200 – 400 basis points (2 – 4%) on thru stock sales.


Though the price analysis web tool is stand alone, it also works in conjunction with our SPA analytics service, combined the integrated measurement platform enables a distributor to quickly and accurately measure the resultant profitability improvements against the SPA contract and thru-stock pricing baselines that existed before the new pricing models were adopted.
