# Driving Customer Engagement

With limited resources available, it can be harder than ever to stay engaged with your customer base. While inside and outside sales can stay in touch with their target accounts, the vast majority of your accounts frequently go without any personal engagement with your business for long periods of time. And increasingly, customers do not have the same availability for relationship building as they once did.

While you may find that 80% of your revenues rests with 20% of your customers, those remaining smaller accounts represent your future. They are your first place to grow sales and expand your operations. It's rare that a distributor gets 100% of a customer's purchases, so moving more of your customer's wallet share to your business is an effective and affordable way to increase market share.

There are several methods at your disposal to engage with your expanded customer base: product gap analysis, access to scorecards and key performance measures, telemarketing, incentives and rewards, new product introductions and so on. Each method, however, requires a common foundation--a deep understanding of the data behind your customers' purchase patterns and a methodology to engage them in a cost effective manner.
