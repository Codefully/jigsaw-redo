# Price Optimization

Jigsaw Systems offers a pricing optimization service focused on thru-stock business and drop ship sales(stock and non-stock), including Special Pricing Agreement (SPA) contracts. 

We begin by evaluating your current profitability performance with an analysis of your company’s thru-stock business. By modelling your customers and products into  buying patterns Jigsaw is able to identify and scale those transactions that are truly price sensitive compared to those where price is less of a factor.

Using a pricing architecture that is tailored to your business, we can improve a company’s non-negotiated sales profitability (including product sold via SPA contracts and products not sold from stock) from 4%-10%+.


Part of our offering is a price analysis web tool is stand alone, allowing clients to monitor and  measure the resultant profitability improvements against the SPA contract and thru-stock pricing baselines that existed before the new pricing models were adopted. Our customized pricing system will provide a new pricing culture focused on making wise price margin decisions that truly reflect the needs of your marketplace.
